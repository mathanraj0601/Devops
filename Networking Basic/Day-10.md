# Day 10
Summary
# IPV6
- Reason for Ipv6 are depletion  of ipv4 address and ineffiency using NAT and private IP
- IPV6 enchances icmp with address resolution
- ipv6 is 128 bit which has 340 undecillion ips
- ipv6 is represent in hexadecimal as 8 hexset (4digit of hex) seperated by colo
- to reduce the ipv6 there are two rules
 - to remove leading zeroes
 - to  use ::(double colon) when there is continous string of hexset with all zeroes

 > note only one double colon is allowed to reduce ambigious so try to use for longest string of all zeroes
